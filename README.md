This is the repository for the In-Company Project (External Company) done as the ESADE Master's Project, led by the students Carlos Rincon &amp; Diego SÃ¡nchez, Master in Business Analytics

The object of study is Gaes, a Spanish brand owned by Italian hearing care multinational, Amplifon. The objective of this study is to develop a sales forecasting model capable of projecting the
next 5 day's worth of sales (today + 5).

The point of this study is to employ all acquired knowledge throughout the length of the master's degree to solve a business problem, decisions such as choosing a model, tuning its 
hyperparameters and concluding with a deployable forecast capable of enhancing a business intelligence tool.

This repository includes all the files with the data used to develop the model, the Jupyter Notebook file itself and a mock-up of the dataset that would be used as a business intelligence tool.
